# Twilio Reminder Texts

This project uses the Google Cloud Cron Scheduler, Flask, and the Twilio API to send reminder texts 
to students about class and office hours start times. 

Note: a number of files have been edited to preserve the privacy of the organization, the staff,
and the students enrolled in the programs since this is a public Github repository. Full original
files are stored in a private repository.
